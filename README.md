# What is mtgo-best-bot?
A GPL-based bot network tool that strictly adheres to Wizards of the Coast, a Hasbro subsidiary's Magic: the Gathering Online Terms of Service. If at any point ToS is broken, this repository must be immediately notified in writing of the specific violation.

# Contributing?
I can deal with arbitrary pull quests. The end game is to dockerize/containerize this bad boy so true Magic: the Gathering bots can be yielded to the masses.

# Conclusion?
Godspeed.
